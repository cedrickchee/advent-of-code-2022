# Advent of Code (AoC) 2022 in Rust

Learning Rust by solving [AoC 2022][aoc22] with AI assisted technologies like
ChatGPT and Copilot.

## Experiment

I got this random idea to see if ChatGPT can reliably solve each day's puzzle
(code problems).

AoC puzzles offer an increasing level of difficulty.

### Goals

I chose to write this year's solutions in Rust. I want to:

- Get much better at Rust
- Improve basic programming skills

### Non-goals

- Evaluate and compare these language models (machine) to human performance.
